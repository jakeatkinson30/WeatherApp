Weather App

For this project I wanted to incorporate real-time data using the OpenWeatherAPI. This API wa simple and easy to work with, which is why I chose this for my first API project. This project furthered my experience in working with API's and JavaScript.

In order to run this application, the user is to type the place they wish to view the weather in, and hit 'enter'.
